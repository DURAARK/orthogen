\section{Assumptions}

The orthophoto generation module performs some assumptions on the scene:

\begin{itemize}
	\item The world coordinate system is a right handed coordinate system, with X and Y spanning the ground plane and Z as up direction.
	\item Input geometry is specified as indexed face set in world coordinates
	\item Input photogrammetric measurements are specified as spherical panoramic image registered to a scanner position 
	(scanner pose and scan range (azimuth/elevation) taken from E57 file)
	\item 
\end{itemize}
