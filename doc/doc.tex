\section{Dependencies}

OrthoGen depends on

\begin{itemize}
  \item libe57 (depends on xerces-c and boost)
  \item PCL
  \item Eigen (contained in PCL)
  \item boost (contained in PCL)
\end{itemize}
 
Build instructions for Windows: 
as Eigen and boost are also dependencies of PCL i use a binary
distribution of PCL and use their 3rdparty libraries.

xerces: can be a bit tricky, but one needs to make sure that UNICODE, the runtime library (MT or MD), and the option "treat wchar\_t as builtin type" is the same on all compiled libraries (libe57 and xerces)

 
\section{Assumptions}

The orthophoto generation module performs some assumptions on the scene:

\begin{itemize}
	\item The world coordinate system is a right handed coordinate system, with X and Y spanning the ground plane and Z as up direction.
	\item Input geometry is specified as indexed face set in world coordinates
	\item Input photogrammetric measurements are specified as spherical panoramic image registered to a scanner position 
	(scanner pose and scan range (azimuth/elevation) taken from E57 file)
	\item 
\end{itemize}


\section{Coordinate Systems}

Scanner local coordinate frame (for panoramic image):
\begin{itemize}
  \item coordinate frame: X right Y front Z up
  \item sphrical coordinates: azimuth, elevation, radius
\end{itemize}
