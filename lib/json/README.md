## Design goals

There are myriads of [JSON](http://json.org) libraries out there, and each may even have its reason to exist. Our class had these design goals:

- **Intuitive syntax**. In languages such as Python, JSON feels like a first class data type. We used all the operator magic of modern C++ to achieve the same feeling in your code. Check out the [examples below](#examples) and you know, what I mean.

- **Trivial integration**. Our whole code consists of a single header file `json.hpp`. That's it. No library, no subproject, no dependencies, no complex build system. The class is written in vanilla C++11. All in all, everything should require no adjustment of your compiler flags or project settings.

- **Serious testing**. Our class is heavily [unit-tested](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/blob/master/test/json_unit.cc) and covers [100%](https://coveralls.io/r/nlohmann/json) of the code, including all exceptional behavior. Furthermore, we checked with [Valgrind](http://valgrind.org) that there are no memory leaks.

Other aspects were not so important to us:

- **Memory efficiency**. Each JSON object has an overhead of one pointer (the maximal size of a union) and one enumeration element (1 byte). The default generalization uses the following C++ data types: `std::string` for strings, `int64_t` or `double` for numbers, `std::map` for objects, `std::vector` for arrays, and `bool` for Booleans. However, you can template the generalized class `basic_json` to your needs.

- **Speed**. We currently implement the parser as naive [recursive descent parser](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_descent_parser) with hand coded string handling. It is fast enough, but a [LALR-parser](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LALR_parser) with a decent regular expression processor should be even faster (but would consist of more files which makes the integration harder).

- **Rigorous Unicode compliance**. We did our best to implement some robust Unicode support. There are still some issues with escaping, and if you run into a problem, please [tell me](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/issues).

## Updates since last version

As of February 2015, the following updates were made to the library

- *Changed:* In the generic class `basic_json`, all JSON value types (array, object, string, bool, integer number, and floating-point) are now **templated**. That is, you can choose whether you like a `std::list` for your arrays or an `std::unordered_map` for your objects. The specialization `json` sets some reasonable defaults.
- *Changed:* The library now consists of a **single header**, called `json.hpp`. Consequently, build systems such as Automake or CMake are not any longer required.
- *Changed:* The **deserialization** is now supported by a lexer generated with [re2c](http://re2c.org) from file [`src/json.hpp.re2c`](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/blob/master/src/json.hpp.re2c). As a result, we follow the JSON specification more strictly. Note neither the tool re2c nor its input are required to use the class.
- *Added:* The library now satisfies the [**ReversibleContainer**](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/concept/ReversibleContainer) requirement. It hence provides four different iterators (`iterator`, `const_iterator`, `reverse_iterator`, and `const_reverse_iterator`), comparison functions, `swap()`, `size()`, `max_size()`, and `empty()` member functions.
- *Added*: The class uses **user-defined allocators** which default to `std::allocator`, but can be templated via parameter `Allocator`.
- *Added:* To simplify pretty-printing, the `std::setw` **stream manipulator** has been overloaded to set the desired indentation. Pretty-printing a JSON object `j` is as simple as `std::cout << std::setw(4) << j << '\n'`.
- *Changed*: The type `json::value_t::number` is now called `json::value_t::number_integer` to be more symmetric compared to `json::value_t::number_float`.

## Integration

The single required source, `json.hpp` file is in the `src` directory. All you need to do is add

```cpp
#include "json.hpp"

// for convenience
using json = nlohmann::json;
```

to the files you want to use JSON objects. That's it. Do not forget to set the necessary switches to enable C++11 (e.g., `-std=c++11` for GCC and Clang).

## Supported compilers

Though it's 2015 already, the support for C++11 is still a bit sparse. Currently, the following compilers are known to work:

- GCC 4.8
- GCC 4.9
- GCC 5.0
- Clang 3.4
- Clang 3.5

I would be happy to learn about other compilers/versions.

Unfortunately, Microsoft Visual C++ support at the moment. MSVC 2013 and MSVC 2014 have been reported not to be able to compile class. Note that I will not accept pull requests that "fix" the code by polluting it with preprocessor directives to mitigate MSVC's lacking C++11 support.

## Examples

Here are some examples to give you an idea how to use the class.

Assume you want to create the JSON object

```json
{
  "pi": 3.141,
  "happy": true,
  "name": "Niels",
  "nothing": null,
  "answer": {
    "everything": 42
  },
  "list": [1, 0, 2],
  "object": {
    "currency": "USD",
    "value": 42.99
  }
}
```

With the JSON class, you could write:

```cpp
// create an empty structure (null)
json j;

// add a number that is stored as double (note the implicit conversion of j to an object)
j["pi"] = 3.141;

// add a Boolean that is stored as bool
j["happy"] = true;

// add a string that is stored as std::string
j["name"] = "Niels";

// add another null object by passing nullptr
j["nothing"] = nullptr;

// add an object inside the object
j["answer"]["everything"] = 42;

// add an array that is stored as std::vector (using an initializer list)
j["list"] = { 1, 0, 2 };

// add another object (using an initializer list of pairs)
j["object"] = { {"currency", "USD"}, {"value", 42.99} };

// instead, you could also write (which looks very similar to the JSON above)
json j2 = {
  {"pi", 3.141},
  {"happy", true},
  {"name", "Niels"},
  {"nothing", nullptr},
  {"answer", {
    {"everything", 42}
  }},
  {"list", {1, 0, 2}},
  {"object", {
    {"currency", "USD"},
    {"value", 42.99}
  }}
};
```

Note that in all these cases, you never need to "tell" the compiler which JSON value you want to use. If you want to be explicit or express some edge cases, the functions `json::array` and `json::object` will help:

```cpp
// ways to express the empty array []
json empty_array_implicit = {{}};
json empty_array_explicit = json::array();

// a way to express the empty object {}
json empty_object_explicit = json::object();

// a way to express an _array_ of key/value pairs [["currency", "USD"], ["value", 42.99]]
json array_not_object = { json::array({"currency", "USD"}), json::array({"value", 42.99}) };
```

### Serialization / Deserialization

You can create an object (deserialization) by appending `_json` to a string literal:

```cpp
// create object from string literal
json j = "{ \"happy\": true, \"pi\": 3.141 }"_json;

// or even nicer (thanks http://isocpp.org/blog/2015/01/json-for-modern-cpp)
auto j2 = R"(
  {
    "happy": true,
    "pi": 3.141
  }
)"_json;

// or explicitly
auto j3 = json::parse("{ \"happy\": true, \"pi\": 3.141 }");
```

You can also get a string representation (serialize):

```cpp
// explicit conversion to string
std::string s = j.dump();    // {\"happy\":true,\"pi\":3.141}

// serialization with pretty printing
// pass in the amount of spaces to indent
std::cout << j.dump(4) << std::endl;
// {
//     "happy": true,
//     "pi": 3.141
// }
```

You can also use streams to serialize and deserialize:

```cpp
// deserialize from standard input
json j;
j << std::cin;

// serialize to standard output
std::cout << j;

// the setw manipulator was overloaded to set the indentation for pretty printing
std::cout << std::setw(4) << j << std::endl;
```

These operators work for any subclasses of `std::istream` or `std::ostream`.

### STL-like access

We designed the JSON class to behave just like an STL container. In fact, it satisfies the [**ReversibleContainer**](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/concept/ReversibleContainer) requirement.

```cpp
// create an array using push_back
json j;
j.push_back("foo");
j.push_back(1);
j.push_back(true);

// iterate the array
for (json::iterator it = j.begin(); it != j.end(); ++it) {
  std::cout << *it << '\n';
}

// range-based for
for (auto element : j) {
  std::cout << element << '\n';
}

// getter/setter
const std::string tmp = j[0];
j[1] = 42;
bool foo = j.at(2);

// other stuff
j.size();     // 3 entries
j.empty();    // false
j.type();     // json::value_t::array
j.clear();    // the array is empty again

// convenience type checkers
j.is_null();
j.is_boolean();
j.is_number();
j.is_object();
j.is_array();
j.is_string();

// comparison
j == "[\"foo\", 1, true]"_json;  // true

// create an object
json o;
o["foo"] = 23;
o["bar"] = false;
o["baz"] = 3.141;

// special iterator member functions for objects
for (json::iterator it = o.begin(); it != o.end(); ++it) {
  std::cout << it.key() << " : " << it.value() << "\n";
}

// find an entry
if (o.find("foo") != o.end()) {
  // there is an entry with key "foo"
}

// or simpler using count()
int foo_present = o.count("foo"); // 1
int fob_present = o.count("fob"); // 0

// delete an entry
o.erase("foo");
```

### Conversion from STL containers

Any sequence container (`std::array`, `std::vector`, `std::deque`, `std::forward_list`, `std::list`) whose values can be used to construct JSON types (e.g., integers, floating point numbers, Booleans, string types, or again STL containers described in this section) can be used to create a JSON array. The same holds for similar associative containers (`std::set`, `std::multiset`, `std::unordered_set`, `std::unordered_multiset`), but in these cases the order of the elements of the array depends how the elements are ordered in the respective STL container.

```cpp
std::vector<int> c_vector {1, 2, 3, 4};
json j_vec(c_vector);
// [1, 2, 3, 4]

std::deque<float> c_deque {1.2, 2.3, 3.4, 5.6};
json j_deque(c_deque);
// [1.2, 2.3, 3.4, 5.6]

std::list<bool> c_list {true, true, false, true};
json j_list(c_list);
// [true, true, false, true]

std::forward_list<int64_t> c_flist {12345678909876, 23456789098765, 34567890987654, 45678909876543};
json j_flist(c_flist);
// [12345678909876, 23456789098765, 34567890987654, 45678909876543]

std::array<unsigned long, 4> c_array {{1, 2, 3, 4}};
json j_array(c_array);
// [1, 2, 3, 4]

std::set<std::string> c_set {"one", "two", "three", "four", "one"};
json j_set(c_set); // only one entry for "one" is used
// ["four", "one", "three", "two"]

std::unordered_set<std::string> c_uset {"one", "two", "three", "four", "one"};
json j_uset(c_uset); // only one entry for "one" is used
// maybe ["two", "three", "four", "one"]

std::multiset<std::string> c_mset {"one", "two", "one", "four"};
json j_mset(c_mset); // only one entry for "one" is used
// maybe ["one", "two", "four"]

std::unordered_multiset<std::string> c_umset {"one", "two", "one", "four"};
json j_umset(c_umset); // both entries for "one" are used
// maybe ["one", "two", "one", "four"]
```

Likewise, any associative key-value containers (`std::map`, `std::multimap`, `std::unordered_map`, `std::unordered_multimap`) whose keys are can construct an `std::string` and whose values can be used to construct JSON types (see examples above) can be used to to create a JSON object. Note that in case of multimaps only one key is used in the JSON object and the value depends on the internal order of the STL container.

```cpp
std::map<std::string, int> c_map { {"one", 1}, {"two", 2}, {"three", 3} };
json j_map(c_map);
// {"one": 1, "two": 2, "three": 3}

std::unordered_map<const char*, float> c_umap { {"one", 1.2}, {"two", 2.3}, {"three", 3.4} };
json j_umap(c_umap);
// {"one": 1.2, "two": 2.3, "three": 3.4}

std::multimap<std::string, bool> c_mmap { {"one", true}, {"two", true}, {"three", false}, {"three", true} };
json j_mmap(c_mmap); // only one entry for key "three" is used
// maybe {"one": true, "two": true, "three": true}

std::unordered_multimap<std::string, bool> c_ummap { {"one", true}, {"two", true}, {"three", false}, {"three", true} };
json j_ummap(c_ummap); // only one entry for key "three" is used
// maybe {"one": true, "two": true, "three": true}
```

### Implicit conversions

The type of the JSON object is determined automatically by the expression to store. Likewise, the stored value is implicitly converted.

```cpp
/// strings
std::string s1 = "Hello, world!";
json js = s1;
std::string s2 = js;

// Booleans
bool b1 = true;
json jb = b1;
bool b2 = jb;

// numbers
int i = 42;
json jn = i;
double f = jn;

// etc.
```

You can also explicitly ask for the value:

```cpp
std::string vs = js.get<std::string>();
bool vb = jb.get<bool>();
int vi = jn.get<int>();

// etc.
```
